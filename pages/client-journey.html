        >Juan came to me like many do, discouraged, worn down, and frustrated
        that the world kept telling him to "just be confident."</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>He has ADHD.</p>
    <p>
      Not the kind that just makes you misplace your keys, the kind that wraps
      around your throat the moment a camera turns on.
    </p>
    <p>He had a story to tell. In fact, he needed to.</p>
    <p>
      But each time he tried, he froze. Stumbled. Stared at the lens like it
      might swallow him whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spent thousands chasing confidence, bought the online courses,
      watched the shiny tutorials, probably memorized every hack some guy with a
      ring light promised would make him "camera ready."
    </p>
    <p><strong>None of it worked.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="section-title">What I Did Differently</h2>
    <p><strong>Then Juan came to me.</strong></p>
    <p>No formulas. No teleprompters. We sat. We slowed down. I listened.</p>
    <p>I gave him space to breathe. To be human. To speak, not perform.</p>
    <p>
      I have been in the industry for decades. I have been behind the lens and
      also on stage. I have stumbled and I have soared. I know the fear. I can
      empathize. I also know what it feels like to finally flip the switch and
      say: "Screw it. I am doing this!"

    <h2>This Is Not About Gear</h2>
    <p>It is not about lights, lenses, or viral hooks.</p>
    <p>
      It is about voice. It is about presence. It is about people being seen.
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes all it takes is someone who actually cares.</p>
    <p>My dad used to say, "A confident person will never go hungry."</p>
    <p>He was right. And it is my job to make sure more people get fed.</p>
