  <p class="lead"><strong>Here is what 30 years behind the camera taught me:</strong></p>
  <p>
    The people who move us are not the loudest or most polished.<br />
    They are the ones who let their truth show.

    That crack in your voice when you share a breakthrough?<br />

<section class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">I Help Experts Become Magnetic On Camera</h2>
  <div class="story-section">
    <p>
      I am Deyson Ortiz.<br />
      Filmmaker. Coach. Student of human connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have directed proffesionals and first-time speakers.<br />
      Edited for Fortune 500s and solo entrepreneurs.<br />
      Coached executives who froze at "action" and creators who could not stop talking.
    </p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>What I discovered:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Your clients do not want to read about you.<br />
      They want to <em>experience</em> you.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crave the person behind the expertise.<br />
      The passion in your voice.<br />
      The conviction only video can capture.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Method Section -->
<section class="section">
  <h2 class="section-title">This Is Not About Learning to "Perform"</h2>
  <div class="story-section">
    <p>
      It is about becoming undeniably you.<br />
      And letting the world come to you because of it.
    </p>
    <p class="lead"><strong>My Camera Confidence Method™ transforms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
          <li>Fear into fuel</li>
          <li>Awkwardness into authenticity</li>
          <li>Hesitation into magnetic presence</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
      In 90 minutes, I help you break through walls that other coaches could not crack in months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because confidence is not about being perfect on camera.<br />
      <strong>It is about being perfectly you.</strong>

    <p class="lead">Three phases. Simple. Human. Effective.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Connect</strong> – We meet as people first. We talk, we laugh, we
      build trust. I see the real you, not the version you think you should be.
      <em>Result: You feel safe to be authentic.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Create</strong> – I put on my producer's hat. We refine your
      message and record together. I am your coach, your guide, and your friend
      in every moment.
      <em>Result: You capture content that sounds like you at your best.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Craft</strong> – We review what you have created. I develop a
      clear plan and equipment recommendations so your next video feels
      effortless. No overwhelm, just progress.
      <em>Result: You leave with confidence and a clear path forward.</em>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Client Who Could Not Hit Record</h2>

  <div class="story-section">
    <p class="lead">How Juan went from frozen to flowing in just 90 minutes.</p>

    <p>
      Juan came to me, stuck.<br />
      Not the stuck you see, the kind that tightens around your throat the
      moment the record light turns red.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had ADHD that made his mind spiral the second he needed to focus. He
      had spent thousands on courses and quick-fix tutorials.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of it worked. Because they were trying to make him someone he was
      not.
    </p>

    <p>I did the opposite. We sat. We slowed down. I listened.</p>

    <p>I gave him space to breathe, to be human, to speak, not perform.</p>

    <p class="lead">
      Ninety minutes later, he recorded his first video. Not perfect. Not
      polished. Real.
    </p>

    <p>
      That one video led to more videos, video courses, and real connections.
    </p>

    <p><em>Today, Juan records videos on his own. No fear. No freeze. Just flow.</em></p>
