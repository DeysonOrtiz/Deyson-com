<!-- Problem Section -->
<section class="story-section">
  <p class="lead">
    You are trapped behind your camera, and you know you should be creating
    videos.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everyone tells you it is the key: more clients, more impact, more income.
  </p>

  <p>
    But every time you hit record, you freeze. You stumble. You sound like a
    stranger to yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    So you write another blog post. Send another email. Make another excuse.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Meanwhile, your competition is building an empire, one video at a time,
    while you stay invisible.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Opportunity Section -->
<section class="story-section">
  <p class="lead">Here is what nobody tells you:</p>

  <p>
    You do not need to be perfect. You do not need a teleprompter, a ring light,
    or a script that sounds like everyone else.
  </p>

  <p>
    You need to be real. Your clients do not want to read about you.<br />
    They want to experience you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your clients want to see the person behind the expertise, hear the passion
    in your voice, and feel the conviction in your message.

  <h2 class="section-title">I Help Experts Become Magnetic</h2>

  <div class="story-section">
    <p>
      I am Deyson Ortiz.<br />
      Filmmaker. Coach. Lifelong student of presence and performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 30 years behind the camera taught me this:<br />
      The people who move us most are not the loudest.<br />
      They are the ones who let their truth show.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">What I do is simple:</p>

    <p>
      I help professionals like you harness the power of your voice and turn it
      into a video presence that gets you paid, trusted, and remembered.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not about learning to "perform."<br />
      This is about becoming
      <strong>undeniably you</strong>,<br />
      and letting the world come to you because of it.

  <h2 class="section-title">How I Work</h2>

  <div class="story-section">
    <p class="lead">Three phases. Simple. Human. Effective.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Connect</strong> – We meet as people first. We talk, we laugh, we
      build trust. I see the real you, not the version you think you should be.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Create</strong> – I put on my producer's hat. We refine your
      message and record together. I am your coach, your guide, and your friend
      in every moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Craft</strong> – We review what you have created. I develop a
      clear plan and equipment recommendations so your next video feels
      effortless. No overwhelm, just progress.

  <div class="story-section">
    <p class="lead">How Juan went from frozen to flowing in just 90 minutes.</p>

    <p>
      Juan came to me, stuck.<br />
      Not the stuck you see, the kind that tightens around your throat the
      moment the record light turns red.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had ADHD that made his mind spiral the second he needed to focus. He
      had spent thousands on courses and quick-fix tutorials.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of it worked. Because they were trying to make him someone he was
      not.
    </p>

    <p>I did the opposite. We sat. We slowed down. I listened.</p>

    <p>I gave him space to breathe, to be human, to speak, not perform.</p>

    <p class="lead">
      Ninety minutes later, he recorded his first video. Not perfect. Not
      polished. Real.
    </p>

    <p>
      That one video led to more videos, video courses, and real connections.
