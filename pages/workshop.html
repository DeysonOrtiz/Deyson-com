    <p>
      This workshop is designed for business owners and entrepreneurs who want
      to leverage video to grow their business and build trust with their
      audience.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might already be comfortable on Zoom calls with clients, but this
      workshop goes far beyond video meetings.
    </p>

    <p>
      We focus on creating content that builds your brand, expands your reach,
      and establishes you as an authority in your field.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>This workshop is ideal if you want to:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create engaging video courses that sell while you sleep</li>
      <li>Build trust and connection with your audience on social media</li>
      <li>Record professional webinars and presentations</li>
      <li>Develop a consistent video content strategy</li>
      <li>Show up confidently on camera, even if it feels uncomfortable now</li>
      <li>
        Save time by recording videos right the first time, without editing
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key difference: this is not about better Zoom meetings.</p>

    <p>
      This is about creating video content that works for your business 24/7,
      building relationships at scale, and positioning yourself as the go-to
      expert in your industry.
