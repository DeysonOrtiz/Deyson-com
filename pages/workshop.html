    <h2 class="section-title">Why This Workshop</h2>

    <p>
      There are countless tutorials on cameras, lights, and gear, as well as
      just as many on speaking with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>This workshop brings both together.</p>

    <p>
      You will learn how to create videos that look professional and feel
      natural, guided by someone who has spent more than thirty years behind the
      camera helping people shine in front of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each session combines technical training with practical coaching, so you
      not only understand your setup but also know how to use it to express your
      message clearly, confidently, and authentically.

    <h2 class="section-title">Who Is This For</h2>

    <p>
      This workshop is tailored for professionals who regularly produce video
      content to grow their businesses, including coaches, real estate agents,
      consultants, online educators, and creators who often appear on camera and
      want to improve their presence and production quality.
    </p>

    <p>Your videos will be genuine, engaging, and foster lasting trust.</p>

    <p>
      Whether you already record often or are just starting to refine your
      delivery, you will learn how to elevate your setup and share your message
      with confidence.

    <h2 class="section-title">Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>
      Every time you step on camera, you are building more than content; you are
      building a connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Video allows people to see your passion, hear your heart, and trust your
      message.
    </p>

    <p>
      Combining confidence with clarity makes your presence genuine, encouraging
      a positive response from your audience. This serves as the foundation for
      meaningful relationships and lasting growth.

    <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Do I need expensive equipment?</h3>
    <p>
      No. You can start with what you already have. I will show you how to
      achieve the best results from your current setup and suggest simple
      upgrades that can make a significant difference.
    </p>

    <h3>Will I get personal feedback?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. During each live session, you can ask questions, share your setup,
      and receive direct guidance to help you look and sound your best.
    </p>

    <h3>What if I miss a session?</h3>
    <p>
      Recordings are available after every session, along with notes and key
      takeaways. You can review them at any time, so you never fall behind.
    </p>

    <h3>How is this different from online tutorials?</h3>
    <p>
      Most tutorials show you what to do. This workshop is interactive and
      personal, blending hands-on practice with feedback that helps you master
      both the tools you use and the presence that builds trust on camera.
