    <h2 class="section-title">Why Both Matter</h2>

    <p>
      Most workshops focus on either the technical side or the confidence side.
      This workshop brings both together because one without the other falls
      short.
    </p>

    <p>
      Great lighting and sound mean nothing if your presence feels stiff or
      uncertain. And all the confidence in the world cannot overcome poor audio
      or distracting visuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you master both the technical fundamentals and the emotional
      presence, something powerful happens. Your videos feel professional and
      authentic at the same time. Your audience can focus on your message
      because nothing technical distracts them, and they trust you because your
      presence feels genuine.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the complete approach. Technical skill creates credibility.
      Authentic presence creates connection. Together, they create trust.
