    <h2>Here is what 30 years behind the camera taught me:</h2>
    <p>
      The people who move us are not the loudest or most polished. They are the
      ones who let their truth show.
    </p>
    <p>
      That crack in your voice when you share a breakthrough? That pause when
      you remember your first failure? That light in your eyes when you talk
      about your passion?
    </p>
    <p><strong>That is your superpower.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="section-title">I Help Experts Become Magnetic On Camera</h2>
    <p>I am Deyson Ortiz. Filmmaker. Coach. Student of human connection.</p>
    <p>
      I have directed professionals and first-time speakers. Coached executives
      who froze at "action" and creators who could not stop talking.
    </p>
    <h3>What I discovered:</h3>
    <p>
      Your clients do not want to read about you.<br />
      They want to experience you.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crave the person behind the expertise.<br />
      The passion in your voice.<br />
      The conviction only video can capture.
    </p>
  </div>

<section class="section-light">

    <h2 class="section-title">This Is Not About Learning to Perform</h2>
    <p>
      It is about becoming undeniably you. And letting the world come to you
      because of it.
    </p>
    <h3>My Camera Confidence Coaching transforms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fear into fuel</li>
      <li>Awkwardness into authenticity</li>
      <li>Hesitation into magnetic presence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In 90 minutes, I help you break through walls that other coaches could not
      crack in months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because confidence is not about being perfect on camera.<br />
      <strong>It is about being perfectly you.</strong>

    <div class="benefits-grid">
      <div>
        <h3>Discover Your Signature Presence</h3>
        <p>
          You are not here to copy anyone. You are here to own what only you can
          say. We will uncover what makes you compelling and sharpen it like a
          chef's knife.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Turn Expertise Into Revenue</h3>
        <p>
          You know your stuff. But if it is stuck in your head, it is not
          helping anyone. Learn how to package your knowledge into content that
          attracts high-paying clients, even while you sleep.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Build Magnetic Authority</h3>
        <p>
          You do not need more followers. You need positioning that makes people
          say, "That is who we need." I will show you how.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Master Authentic Authority</h3>
        <p>
          Not slick. Not scripted. Just present. Using performance techniques
          that I will help you present on camera in a way that cuts through the
          noise.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Scale Your Voice</h3>
        <p>
          One video, thousands of views. One story, endless connection. We will
          build you a content engine that runs while you live your life.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Technical Mastery Without the Headache</h3>
        <p>
          Forget chasing gear and watching hours of YouTube. I will simplify
          your setup and make your presence shine. No clutter. Just clarity.

    <p>
      <strong>How Juan went from frozen to flowing in just 90 minutes.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Juan came to me, stuck. Not the stuck you see, the kind that tightens
      around your throat the moment the record light turns red.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ADHD that made his mind spiral the second he needed to focus. He
      had spent thousands on courses and quick-fix tutorials.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of it worked. Because they were trying to make him someone he was
      not.
    </p>
    <p>I did the opposite. We sat. We slowed down. I listened.</p>
    <p>I gave him space to breathe, to be human, to speak, not perform.</p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Ninety minutes later, he recorded his first video. Not perfect. Not
        polished. Real.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      That one video led to more videos, video courses, and real connections.
    </p>
    <p class="testimonial-quote">
      Today, Juan records videos on his own. No fear. No freeze. Just flow.
    </p>

      The biggest mistake is not failing at video. It is taking too long to try.

      someone willing to show up imperfectly.
