Get paid quickly with this strategy: Offer a discount to clients who pay in full upfront.Â 

You get paid right away and they get a cost-saving advantage. ðŸ’¸

When I first start working on a project, many times I make it a point to include a provision in the contract offering a discount to clients who opt to pay the full amount upfront.Â 

This mutually beneficial arrangement not only enables me to receive payment in advance but also provides the client with a cost-saving advantage.Â 

By enabling early payment, we establish a positive working relationship built on trust and cooperation.Â 

It guarantees that I can dedicate my efforts to the project without any payment concerns, and clients can enjoy a more affordable service.Â 

Throughout the project, I also prioritize keeping the client up to date on the progress, ensuring they are involved every step of the way.Â 

Regular communication, milestone reviews, and open channels for feedback not only provide the client with transparency but also safeguard their interests.Â 

By maintaining this level of engagement, we cultivate a partnership that ensures both parties are satisfied and invested in the project's success.Â 

Together, we create a win-win scenario where both parties enjoy the benefits.

What do you think? What strategies do you use to guarantee payment?Â
