It is essential to ensure our tools can get the job done when we need to work. For a long time, the use of low-cost or free software on a professional project was unheard of or looked down upon.Â 

The thing with these types of software is that they take a while to become popular and stable. When we do find them, they can be buggy, slow, or not just quite there yet.Â   
â€‹  
But, they have something very important, and that is potential.Â   
â€‹  
When a tool has potential it gathers momentum faster and faster. People start to lend their support, whether that is through talent, money, skills, or word of mouth.

Over the years I have been incredibly impressed by the power of low-cost and free tools. Some of my favorite low-cost or free tools include [Blender](https://www.blender.org), [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), [FFMPEG](http://ffmpeg.org), [Apple Motion](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/motion/), [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io), [Figma](https://www.figma.com), [Auto-Editor](https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor), and many more.

I have also worked with tools that started as unknowns and grew into something hugely impactful, such as D-Vision, then Discreet Edit\*, Final Cut Pro, Blender, Black Magic, and Red Cameras.

I advise you to take the time to seek out tools that have promise, support them, reach out to their developers, and keep an eye on them.Â   
â€‹  
We never know how useful they may become. Or maybe they become your personal tool that gets work done in a fraction of the time. Allowing more time with the family, friends, or for yourself.Â   
â€‹  
Some places I search for new tools are [ProductHunt.com](http://ProductHunt.com), [GitHub.com](http://GitHub.com), [Open Source Builders](https://opensource.builders), Web Catalog io, and [Awesome Open Source](https://awesomeopensource.com).
