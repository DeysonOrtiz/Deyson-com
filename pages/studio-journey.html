  <p>
    Jill had a message.<br />A show to share.<br />And a clear vision of how it
    should feel.
  </p>

  <p>She was tired of borrowed space.<br />Tired of making do.</p>

  <p class="lead">She wanted something of her own.</p>

  <p>
    Not just a room with lights.<br />But a studio that worked.<br />A space
    that gave her confidence.<br />And made her guests feel welcome and seen.

  <p class="lead">That is where I came in.</p>
