When it comes to recording stand-up videos, I have a fantastic tip that can greatly enhance your performance. 

Instead of relying solely on your memory or reading directly from a script, I recommend using a helpful app called [Imaginary Teleprompter](https://imaginary.tech/teleprompter/) or any teleprompter app you prefer.

However, the key is not to use the teleprompter for word-for-word reading, as that can make us sound robotic. 

Instead, I suggest using it for reading notes. 

Since the teleprompter scrolls, we can quickly glance down and stay on topic without losing our flow.

Here is how it works: Familiarize yourself with the script in sections rather than trying to memorize every single word. 

Get a grasp of the overall idea and structure. 

If you happen to forget the next part while recording, simply pause, take a breath, and refer to the teleprompter to refresh your memory.

Do not worry about the breaks and pauses you take during recording. 

These can be easily edited out manually or automated with the help of editing tools. 

You can also employ push cuts, a technique where you create the illusion of a second camera angle by scaling up the video slightly.

By taking your time, strategically editing out any breaks, and using push cuts, you can achieve a seamless and professional-looking video.
