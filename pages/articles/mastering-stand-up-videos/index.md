I have a tip for enhancing your performance when recording stand-up videos if you have difficulty remembering what to say.

Typically, I recommend against using teleprompters. But there are times when they can be helpful, especially if you are getting started.

However, the key is not to use the teleprompter for word-for-word reading, as that can make us sound robotic. 

Instead, I suggest using it for keywords to trigger our memory.

Since the teleprompter scrolls, we can use keywords to stay on topic without losing our flow.

Remember, your videos should aim to discuss topics you know well. It is better if you can speak from the heart.

Find topics that you are passionate about and that you can speak about with confidence. Think of conversations that you have had with friends or family members.

The goal of keywords is to stay on topic without losing our flow. Think of keywords that you can use to guide your conversation.

If you go blank, pause, take a breath, and refer to the teleprompter to refresh your memory.

Do not worry about the breaks and pauses you take during recording. 

These can be easily edited out manually.
Or keep them, as there is nothing wrong with being human.

The important thing is to speak with passion and to have fun!
