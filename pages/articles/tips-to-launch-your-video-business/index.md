Are you dreaming of starting your own video/creative business? 

Below, I have shared my top tips and essential knowledge to help you embark on this journey with confidence and less stress. 

Being an entrepreneur has been one of my most challenging yet rewarding experiences. 

It is a path filled with highs and lows, rules to navigate, and endless learning and managing as your business evolves. 

Many find the idea daunting, and rightfully so, but the rewards of business ownership—limitless growth and the opportunity to connect with incredible people—are truly amazing.

Once you are ready and have researched the demand for your business idea, here are some insights I have gathered along the way, things I wish I knew from the start that may help: 

- **Emergency Fund**: Vital for any entrepreneur.   
    Calculate your monthly expenses and multiply this by three to twelve months, longer is better. This fund acts as your creative freedom and stress reliever, offering a buffer during slower times.  
    ​

- **Legal Consultation**: Meeting or consulting with a lawyer ensures your contracts and business structure are set up correctly from the beginning. It is not about hiring full-time but avoiding overlooked mistakes.  
    ​

- **Accountant Advice**: An accountant's insights on taxes and business structure are invaluable. They can also help connect you with other business owners, providing a support network right from the start.  
    ​

- **Find a Mentor**: Seek guidance from someone successful in your field. Mentors can be invaluable, offering advice and support as you grow. Do not hesitate to reach out—many are willing to help, sometimes even for free.  
    ​

- **Join Mastermind Groups**: Engaging with local or online groups of entrepreneurs can offer support, insights, and perspectives you might miss on your own. I cherish my weekly meetings with my Mastermind Group.  
    ​

- **Educate Yourself**: Books on business are a treasure trove of knowledge. While entertainment is great, dedicating time to learning about business management is crucial.  
    ​

- **Hiring Help**: It is okay to delegate, but understanding every part of your business is essential for those times you might need to step in.  
    ​

- **Network Actively:** Always seek advice from fellow business owners you meet every day. Many are eager to help and could even become clients. This approach broadens your knowledge and opens new opportunities.  
    ​

- **Leverage Online Expertise**: Discover experts like [Justin Welsh](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/dpheh0hzhm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuanVzdGlud2Vsc2gubWUvYXJ0aWNsZXM=), whose insights have been invaluable for streamlining my business and reducing stress. Explore his resources or find an expert online whose guidance resonates with you. Embrace the journey without it feeling like a constant struggle. 

​  
These tips are just the beginning, but they can significantly reduce the stress and uncertainty of starting and running a business. 

Owning a business is a journey of learning and growth and I wish you much success and happiness on this adventure.
