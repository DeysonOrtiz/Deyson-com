Based on the feedback I have received regarding the biggest challenges in video creation, the most common response is the actual video editing process.

I completely understand that video editing can be quite daunting. It involves mixing audio to ensure it sounds good, ensuring smooth transitions, and presenting the story in an engaging yet not overwhelming manner for viewers.

However, video editing is a necessary step.

To make this process easier for you, I would like to share some helpful tricks based on my past experiences.

If you are interested in editing your own videos, I advise using the simplest and most stable tool available.

Personally, I highly recommend [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/) if you have a Macintosh or an iPad. I find iMovie to be user-friendly compared to other editing tools.

It may not have all the advanced features, but it provides enough functionality to effectively tell your story.

It is an all-in-one tool that comes pre-installed on your device, allowing you to start using it immediately. While I primarily use Mac, I am sure comparable tools are also available for PC users.

Another recommendation is to consider finding an editor who can polish your rough cut.

You can edit your piece using iMovie or any other tool you prefer, and then send the project to an editor who will enhance it by adding professional touches.

They can improve the audio quality, apply suitable transitions, and refine the overall video. This approach can save you both time and money.

Providing a rough cut reduces the editor's workload, thus reducing the cost.

I have utilized this approach with producers and clients who had budget and time constraints. I advised them to handle the initial editing themselves, and then I took care of the final cleanup of the video.

Another option to explore is finding a college student who is looking to build their portfolio.

You can collaborate with a student from a nearby college and work on the project together. This arrangement benefits both parties: the student gets to enhance their reputation and portfolio, while you get your videos edited.

Please keep in mind that patience is essential when working with students, as they are still learning and gaining experience with the tools and project development. However, this can also be a money-saving solution.

If budget is not a concern, my advice is to send everything to a professional editor and have them handle the entire process.

Before starting, it is important to establish a budget that you are comfortable with for each video and communicate it to the editor from the beginning.

This helps the editor understand their limitations and they can provide feedback on how to produce the videos within that budget.

To save money they might suggest making shorter videos, working off a rough cut, or allowing them more time for editing. Sometimes, editors can adjust the price if they are given more time to work on a project.

Additionally, there are online and other tools available that can significantly save time.

For example, if you prefer editing with text rather than video, you can use tools like [Descript](https://www.descript.com).

Descript has a useful feature that allows you to edit your videos by simply removing words from the transcribed text. By cutting out certain words, your video is automatically edited accordingly.

Once you are done with the initial edit, you can choose to directly post the video online or pass it on to an editor for the final touches to match your vision.

In conclusion, video editing may present its challenges, but with the right approach and tools, you can overcome them and create compelling videos.

Whether you choose to dive into editing yourself using user-friendly software like iMovie or collaborate with an editor to enhance your rough cuts, there are solutions available to suit your needs and budget.

Additionally, consider leveraging the talents of college students or exploring time-saving online tools like Descript to streamline the editing process.

Remember to communicate your budget and goals clearly to your editor, and do not forget to exercise patience throughout the learning process.

With practice, perseverance, and a creative vision, you will be on your way to producing captivating videos that engage and inspire your audience. Happy editing!
