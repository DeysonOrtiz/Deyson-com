Are you a digital artist?

Start earning extra income by launching your very own online store today.

I have been running an online store for almost 15 years. Below I share some tips to help you get started:

\- Start with free templates. This will help get the word out and allow people to test your product. This is a great way to market your new store.

\- Start with very simple designs. This will allow you to grow and allow your customers to add their own creativity. If customers want more complex designs they can hire you for customization or try the premium templates. To start, think holistically, and think of frameworks. This will help as you grow. If you make them too complex, you may have upset or frustrated customers. You want to grow with your audience's feedback. Keep them simple and effective.

\- Create as much documentation and tutorials as possible. The fewer questions your customers have, the less time you will spend on customer support and more time designing.

\- Use services such as Gumroad, SendOwl, or PayHip to get you started. They can help distribute your product. This will allow you to share your products for free with an option for people to pay what they want ($0+) and also add upsells, such as training, custom work, or bonuses.

\- Collect people's email so they can get notified of updates, new products, and announcements. Your newsletter list will be the most valuable thing you own in the long run.

\- Pay attention to small details. It is the small details that separate the amateurs from the pros. Treat your free templates as you would treat premium templates. People will trust and respect you and expect the same level of quality in all of your products. Pay attention to spacing, alignment, spelling, labeling, consistency, etc...

\- Reach out to people you know and respect and ask them to use your templates as examples to showcase your template demos. People love to see real-world examples. Plus it is a great way for them to help promote you and a great way to test the templates. Take it a step further and find high-achieving people on social and make a version for them. They may promote you and your work. It is a great way to stand out.

I hope these tips help you and I have many more.

If you are a digital artist and want to earn extra income start your online store today. The sooner you start the sooner you will see results.  
  
It may take a while to build a stable income, but with enough hard work and dedication, you will see something flourish.

Plus your store will make for a great portfolio, a great way to connect with people, a great way to create an additional stream of income and build something you can call your own and possibly add some freedom to your life.

The most important tip of all, have fun!Â

Start to read books on entrepreneurship, marketing, and business.
