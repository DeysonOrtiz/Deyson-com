**Hello everyone! üôÇüëã‚Å£**

For a while now, I have been trying to create a solution for captions that I can fully style for **[Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)**.

I have tested multiple tools, including some I discovered on GitHub. However, during a recent project, I needed something quick.

So, I downloaded **["Caption Generator for Final Cut Pro"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/caption-generator-for-finalcut/id1666645487?mt=12)** from the App Store. Mainly because it was free (at the time of this writing) and seemed to have enough of what I needed.

After testing it and being happy with the results, I opened the included _Motion File_ that came with the app and started customizing.

I then added some of my parameters such as text animation sequence controls and also modified it so the text auto-fills the title safe area for YouTube Reels, ensuring the captions are never covered up by the YouTube icon, UI, and description.

Below is a test of what I came up with:

I am going to add more options like glow and background controls so the text stands out over lighter videos.

I have not yet tested this workflow in [Captionator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/captionator-for-final-cut/id1627843786?mt=12), but since both tools seem very similar, I would assume they both work the same with advanced customization using Apple Motion.

**Tip:** We can adjust the individual word size by highlighting the word we want to adjust in the text box and then scaling the text size in Final Cut Pro.

Going forward, I will be providing updates on my progress. I encourage you all to share any suggestions or requests you might have.

My goal is to make this solution something that others can use as well.  
I will be sharing the project files and tutorial soon so you can see what I did.

Please let me know what you think.  
Thank you, and have an Outstanding Day!
