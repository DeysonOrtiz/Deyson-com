In this article, I will discuss the importance of treating everyone with genuine respect!  
â€‹  
I had the opportunity to edit a video for a well-known celebrity many years ago.Â   
â€‹  
On camera, this person is portrayed as wonderful, smiling, kind, and nice.Â   
â€‹  
However, behind the scenes, their behavior took a turn for the worse.  
â€‹  
The celebrity would become mean and rude to the staff and the people around them as soon as the director called "cut."Â   
â€‹  
It became clear that this person struggled to maintain positive relationships with talented individuals.Â   
â€‹  
In the entertainment industry, word spreads quickly, whether it is about someone's good or bad behavior.  
â€‹  
My advice is simple: strive to be a good person both on camera and off.Â   
â€‹  
The impact of this celebrity's behavior was significant, not only on the people directly involved on set but even on me weeks after the filming concluded.Â   
â€‹  
The initial excitement and inspiration I felt were quickly replaced by demotivation upon witnessing this transformation.  
â€‹  
While it is possible to fake kindness while on set, such a facade will eventually wear thin and become tiresome.Â   
â€‹  
Instead, make a conscious effort to genuinely work on being a kind and respectful individual.Â   
â€‹  
Just like any ambition in life, if we aim for success, we must be willing to put in the effort.Â   
â€‹  
This may involve altering the way we interact with others, ensuring that respect is at the forefront of our interactions.  
â€‹  
A producer friend of mine once shared an insightful observation with me: the individuals who have longevity in this industry are those who consistently display kindness toward others.Â   
â€‹  
Regardless of the amount of talent one possesses, if we lack genuine kindness, it will eventually have negative repercussions.Â   
â€‹  
So, as you venture out into the world to share your talents, remember that being nice and treating others with respect is of utmost importance.Â   
â€‹  
Embrace a positive attitude and let it shine through your interactions.Â   
â€‹  
By doing so, you not only enhance your chances of success but also contribute to a more positive and harmonious environment for everyone involved.Â   
â€‹  
Good luck! ðŸ™‚
