It is amazing to see so many people diving into the world of content creation.Â 

I have been doing my best to share advice from my time in this incredible industry of video creation.

My name is Deyson, and for over 30 years, I have helped edit and produce a wide range of content from TV commercials and infomercials to short films, Corporate Videos, and more.  
â€‹  
I truly love what I do and enjoy sharing what I have learned.

So, in this post, I want to share some tips that I believe will make your video content creation journey much more enjoyable:  
â€‹

1. **Focus on the content first.**Â   
    We often get lost in perfecting the lighting or equipment but overlook the most crucial element, the content itself.Â   
    â€‹  
    Start by writing content that provides value to your audience, whether through entertainment, education, or both. A mix of these can resonate with viewers.  
    â€‹

3. **Keep it simple.**Â   
    It is easy to get caught up in the details like background, titles, effects, and b-roll.Â   
    â€‹  
    While those elements can enhance a video, they are secondary to your message and how you deliver it.Â   
    â€‹  
    Ensure you present well, maintain a smile, and show excitement about your story.Â   
    â€‹  
    Audiences appreciate a simple video with a passionate presenter more than fancy effects.Â   
    â€‹  
    Bob Ross's enduring popularity is a testament to this approach.  
    â€‹

5. **Audio is crucial.**Â   
    Before you start recording, prioritize getting your audio right.Â   
    â€‹  
    Poor audio quality can quickly drive your audience away.Â   
    â€‹  
    Strive to capture the clearest sound possible from the beginning.Â   
    â€‹  
    While post-production tools can improve audio, nothing beats great sound captured at the source.  
    â€‹

7. **Lighting is key.**Â   
    Even before considering which camera to use, focus on your lighting.Â   
    â€‹  
    Good lighting can significantly enhance the quality of your videos.Â   
    â€‹  
    I have learned from working with an amazing cinematographer that a well-lit scene shot on a lower-quality camera can look better than a poorly lit scene on a high-end camera.Â   
    â€‹  
    Quality lighting can elevate your footage, regardless of the camera.  
    â€‹

9. **Have fun.**Â   
    The energy you invest in your work can be felt by your audience.Â   
    â€‹  
    If you are creating content, choose topics you are passionate about. If you are an editor, seek out projects that excite you.Â   
    â€‹  
    Love, passion, and fun are attractive qualities that can reach your audience, no matter the distance or time.  
    â€‹

11. **Have a budget.**Â   
    It is easy to overspend on creative projects, so it is vital to set a budget and adhere to it.Â   
    â€‹  
    Better yet, try to come in under budget for added security.Â   
    â€‹  
    The goal is to not only create great content but also to sustain your ability to create in the future.

I hope these tips are helpful.Â 

Remember, the most important tip is to have fun; it is the key to longevity in this field.Â 

The creative industry can be challenging, blending art, passion, sharing, finances, and technical aspects, but the fun is what keeps us going. So, enjoy even the tough parts.

Thank you, and I hope you have a fantastic day! ðŸ˜Š
