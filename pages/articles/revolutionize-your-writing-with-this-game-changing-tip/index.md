I am thrilled to pass on to you a wonderful tip that has entirely changed the way I approach writing. Thank you Jose Rosado for this tip. ðŸ™‚

I believe it to be a game-changer, and I am eager to hear what you think.

So here is the tip: I use [Otter.io](http://otter.io) to convert my voice recordings of topics I intend to write about into text. It is a wonderful tool that accurately and quickly records what I say.

It saves me a ton of time over manually inputting everything. It gets even better though, because after transcribing my recordings, I use [ChatGPT's](https://chat.openai.com) "Make this better" prompt to improve my writing.

It is similar to having an always-available personal writing coach.

ChatGPT evaluates my transcription and suggests improvements.

Using this method, I can produce high-quality content rapidly and with the least amount of effort.

The best thing, though? I still have the opportunity to check the finished product for tone and style.

So, have you tried anything similar? Please let me know your thoughts! ðŸ™‚

Also, do you need help creating custom templates for your business or need video assistance, training or coaching? I can help! Please sign up for my newsletter to learn more.
