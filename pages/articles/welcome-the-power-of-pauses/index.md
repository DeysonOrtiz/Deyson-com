Lately, I have observed that some video editors choose to eliminate pauses in order to fit their videos into specific time constraints.  
  
However, I believe it would be more beneficial for them to remove sentences and content while keeping certain pauses.  
  
Pauses and breaks are just as important as the content itself.  
  
They provide our brains with an opportunity to process information, reflect, make connections, and maintain our human touch.  
  
To demonstrate this point, let us consider how we would communicate with a real human being.  
  
Would we want them to speak continuously without any breaks?  
  
Would that not make us feel overwhelmed if someone approached us and bombarded us with information without allowing us a chance to breathe?  
  
Let us celebrate those pauses.  
  
We genuinely need them.  
  
They play an integral role in the conversation and contribute greatly to its overall effectiveness.
